### What is it?
This is a program that was made for an AP Statistics project to demonstrate the probabilities of the bank/player winning with various amount of dice.  The player (red dice) is a special 8 sided die with 3 of the side having 5 dots, while the rest of the sides having the value 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.  The bank (green dice) are just regular 6 siced dice.
### How does it work?
The user selects the number of dice they want for the bank and player.  They have the choice of running the simulation once or they can run the simulation multiple times, as long as there is a number entered in the "Number of Simulations" dialog box.  The clear button clears all the statistics regarding the number of wins and the probabilities for the bank/player.
### How do I run it?
All that is needed is a Python 3 interpreter and the files in this repository.  Please note that the .gif files need to be in the same folder as the execuited "Custom Dice Simulator.py" file.  Once the files are unzipped and in a folder, set the current working directory to that folder and run `python3 Custom\ Dice\ Simulator.py`.
